# US-2015-Census

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of US 2015 census dataset
The notebook contains interactive charts created using ipywidgets and plotly
Unfortunately, Github renders a static representation of notebooks, so interactive charts are not displayed.
The plotly maps can be viewd by clicking on the link below:

To view the interactive charts created using ipywidgets, you will have to run the notebook on your local computer.
I have included all data used for this project so you can run them locally if you chose to.

**NOTE**: This notebook might be updated in the future with more insighs
